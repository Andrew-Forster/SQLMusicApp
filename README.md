# Music Database GUI Application (CRUD Operations)

## Overview
This project involves developing a Windows Forms App (WinForms) using Visual Studio, C#, and a MySQL database to manage a music collection. The application allows users to view, add, update, and delete albums in the music database. The project is divided into three main phases: setting up the database, creating a user interface with basic CRUD functionalities, and completing all CRUD elements.

### Part 1: Setting Up the Database
In the first phase, we focused on defining the structure of the music database in MySQL. This involved:
- Creating tables to store album details such as title, artist, year, image URL, and description.
- Populating the database with initial album data.
- Writing SQL queries to manage data retrieval and modifications, setting the foundation for the GUI application.

### Part 2: Creating the User Interface and Initial CRUD Elements
In the second phase, we built the graphical user interface (GUI) using WinForms in Visual Studio. Key tasks included:
- Designing the UI with buttons, text fields, and a data grid to display albums.
- Creating C# classes to represent the albums and manage data operations.
- Implementing basic CRUD functionalities: users can view and add albums via the interface.
- Establishing the connection between the GUI and the MySQL database using SQL queries to load and display album data.

### Part 3: 
`In Progress...`

This project showcases my ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies, create database-driven applications, and develop user-friendly interfaces that handle data effectively.
